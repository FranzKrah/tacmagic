This is a beta version (not fully tested; use at own risk) of an R package to process and analyze time-activity curve (TAC) data from positron emission tomography (PET) studies.

The package provides loading functions to work with processed PET data, such as TAC, ROI volumes and ROI statistics (e.g. Logan, R1, etc.) in a common format regardless of the software that created them (e.g. PMOD). This then enables subsequent statistical calculations.

If you are interested in these scripts, or have any questions, suggestions, and especially if you see any problems, please contact me at eb@ericebrown.com. I am interested in improving these scripts and making them more useful. If you 
do use them, please acknowledge/cite this in your work.

## Features

### Data loading and weighted-averages

### Time-activity curve plotting

### SUVR calculation

### Non-invasive Logan reference method

### Batch and group-wise analysis
