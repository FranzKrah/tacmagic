# PET Analysis in R

This is a beta version (not fully tested; use at own risk) of an R package to process and analyze time-activity curve (TAC) data from positron emission tomography (PET) studies.

The package provides loading functions to work with processed PET data, such as TAC, ROI volumes and ROI statistics (e.g. Logan, R1, etc.) in a common format regardless of the software that created them (e.g. PMOD). This then enables subsequent statistical calculations.

These scripts are in NO WAY affiliated with or endorsed by PMOD Technologies. 

If you are interested in these scripts, or have any questions, suggestions, and especially if you see any problems, please contact me at eric.brown@utoronto.ca. I am interested in improving these scripts and making them more useful. If you 
do use them, please acknowledge/cite this in your work.

## Features

### Data loading and weighted-averages

Supports formats exported from the PMOD suite of software. Combines atlas-based ROIs into larger ROIs as defined in standardROIs() or fullROIs() (or by the user), weighted for volume.

### SUVR calculation

Calculate standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) for regions of interest (ROIs). For large ROIs made up of several smaller ROIs, calculates the mean SUVR weighted the subROIs by volume. It also weights the SUVR by frame length.

### Logan 

In progress/testing.

### Batch and group-wise analysis

Calculates SUVR and other statistics for groups of participants.

### Time-activity curve calculation and plotting

Calculates time-activity curves for individual ROIs, individual participants, groups, and has basic plotting functions for 1 or more TACs.
