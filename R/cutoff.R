# "In an effort to standardize the definition of amyloid positivity, we used an iterative, objective 
# procedure to identify high outliers in the control group. A “mild” or “suspect” outlier was defined in 
# the standard manner as any observation more than 1.5 the interquartile range higher than the third 
# quartile,41 that is, any observation higher than the upper-inner fence of the box-and-whisker plot of 
# the data. 
#
# This calculation was performed using 62 clinically unimpaired control subjects (43 from 
# this study and 19 from other related studies). The brain areas used for this calculation were those 
# that most commonly show amyloid deposition in AD patients (ACG; frontal, PRC/PCG, parietal, lateral 
# temporal, and lateral occipital cortices; and occipital pole). After determining which subjects 
# were outliers for any of these neocortical brain areas, we removed those subjects from the analysis 
# and repeated the calculation until there were no outliers remaining. The process required 2 iterations: 
# 12 outliers were removed on the first iteration and 4 on the second. We were left with a core group 
# of 46 controls (74%) who were considered very unlikely to be amyloid-positive. 
#
# The cutoff value for amyloid positivity was defined as the upper-inner fence of the 46 control subjects for each of the 7 
# key brain areas listed previously. Any subject who had a PiB DVR value that exceeded this cutoff point 
# in any of these 7 brain areas was defined as amyloid-positive. [...] we eliminated 
# the effect of doubtful cases near this cutoff point by excluding the 5 subjects (12%) with PiB DVR 
# values within 2.5% above or below the cutoff value and compared the 9 subjects clearly above the 
# cutoff point (21%) with the 29 sub- jects clearly below (67%)."

#' Cutoff value caluclation using method described in Aizenstein et al. 2008
#' 
#' See references()$Aizenstein. The authors proposed a standardized method of 
#' calculating PIB+ cutoff values to classify participants as PIB+ or PIB-. They
#' used the DVR from several ROIs associated with amyloid deposition. The steps 
#' are summarized below. cutoff_aiz() implements 1-3, returning cutoff values
#' for each ROI. It can be used to dichotomize participants, with pos_anyroi().
#' 
#' 1. Remove outliers from a group of cognitively normal individuals. An outlier
#' is defined as having any ROI with DVR > upper inner fence of that ROI (= 3rd 
#' quartile + (1.5 * IQR).
#' 2. Iterate step 1 as needed until there are no more outlying participants.
#' 3. From this subset of the group with outliers removed, the cutoff value for 
#' each ROI is set as the upper inner fence. 
#' 4. For all participants, if there is any ROI above the cutoff for that 
#' region, then the participant is deemed to be PIB+.
